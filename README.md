# FiveM-RP-Essentials

Essential scripts for a good RP server.

I was searching for a script like this when I first started out with FiveM RP Dev, so I didn't have to go through the hassle of setting up 10 individual scripts (bad practice too) which could all be merged in to one. That's why I'm releasing this.

Good luck with your RP server!

I kindly ask you to report any bug/suggestion down below.
